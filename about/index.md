Hi, I’m Hélio. As a developer, my working projects include developing front and backends for web applications. I’m passionate about web standards and related technologies such as accessibility, usability and user experience for any device capable of accessing the Internet.

I’m married, based in Rio de Janeiro, and I was born in Natal, and grew up in João Pessoa, and I cheer wildly for the Corinthians soccer team. Okay, bit crazy.

What about you? Let’s talk!
